/**
 * Shared by Create/UpdateAppointmentUseCase's assertNoActiveSameDayConflict()
 * — previously both threw "Patient already has an active appointment
 * (...) on {datetime}{department}." regardless of the conflicting record's
 * actual status. That wording is only accurate while the conflict is still
 * `scheduled` (a real booking). Once it has progressed to waiting_triage/
 * waiting_provider/in_consultation, the patient has already arrived and is
 * being actively worked — describing that as "has an appointment" reads as
 * if nothing has happened yet, which is what prompted this fix. Appointment
 * stays the source of truth here (see the patient flow redesign's research:
 * Encounter has no "active encounter for patient" query today and no
 * operational queue reads it — rebasing this check onto Encounter is a
 * separate, larger effort, not a wording fix).
